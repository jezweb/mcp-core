That is an excellent and very insightful question. You have correctly identified the next crucial step in the architectural modernization.

You are correctâ€”in the *current state* of the code, these new JSON files in `definitions/prompts/` and `definitions/resources/` are **not yet being used** by the running application.

They represent the **new, modernized "source of truth"** for all prompts and resources. The old, large TypeScript files (`shared/resources/resources.ts` and `shared/prompts/prompt-templates.ts`) are now considered **legacy** and will be replaced by files that are **auto-generated** from these new JSON definitions.

---

### **The Problem We Are Solving**

Let's look at the example you provided, `api-reference.json`.

**The Old Way (Hard to Maintain):**
Previously, the content for this resource was hardcoded inside a massive TypeScript object in `shared/resources/resources.ts`. To edit the markdown, a developer had to:
1.  Open a huge TypeScript file.
2.  Navigate through complex object syntax.
3.  Carefully edit the content inside a template literal string, being careful not to break the TypeScript syntax.
4.  Adding a new resource was a cumbersome process of adding to multiple objects within the same file.

**The New Way (Modular and Easy):**
The new architecture separates the *definition* of a resource (the data) from the *runtime logic* of the application (the code).

*   **The JSON files are the definitions.** Each resource, like `api-reference.json`, is now a simple, self-contained data file. It's easy to read, easy to edit, and can be validated against a schema.
*   **A build script is the bridge.** A script (`definitions/scripts/build.js`) will be responsible for reading all these individual JSON files and automatically generating the TypeScript files that the application actually uses.

### **How It Works: The Build Process**

This is the missing link that makes the whole system work. Here is the flow:

```
[JSON Definition Files] ---> [The Build Script] ---> [Auto-Generated .ts File] ---> [The Application]
      (The Source)           (The "Compiler")           (The Runtime Code)         (What uses the code)
```

1.  A developer adds or edits a simple `.json` file in the `definitions/` directory.
2.  They run a build command (e.g., `npm run definitions:build`).
3.  The build script (`definitions/scripts/build.js`) scans the directories, reads all the `.json` files, validates them, and compiles them into the final `shared/resources/resources.ts` and `shared/prompts/prompt-templates.ts` files.
4.  The rest of the application, which already imports from these TypeScript files, works perfectly without any changes, but now it's using the fresh, auto-generated data.

### **Benefits of This New Architecture**

*   **Maintainability:** To add, edit, or remove a resource, you just manage a single, simple JSON file. You no longer have to touch the complex, monolithic TypeScript files.
*   **Scalability:** We can now have hundreds of resources and prompts without the core files becoming unmanageable.
*   **Validation:** We can automatically check every JSON file against a schema (`resource-schema.json`) to ensure it's structured correctly, preventing common errors.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The data (what a resource *is*) is cleanly separated from the application logic (how the server *uses* resources).
*   **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on different resource files simultaneously without causing merge conflicts in one giant file.

### **Action Plan for the AI Developer**

Your observation is perfectly timed. The next step is to make this new, superior system fully functional.

#### **Action 1: Enhance the Build Script**

*   **Task:** The current `definitions/scripts/build.js` is already set up to handle `tools`. It needs to be enhanced to also process `resources` and `prompts`.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Add functions to scan `definitions/resources/` and `definitions/prompts/`.
    2.  For each JSON file found, read and parse it.
    3.  Validate it against `resource-schema.json` or `prompt-schema.json`.
    4.  Aggregate all the data.
    5.  Write the final, auto-generated `shared/resources/resources.ts` and `shared/prompts/prompt-templates.ts` files.

#### **Action 2: Migrate All Existing Resources and Prompts**

*   **Task:** Manually migrate the content from the old monolithic TypeScript files into the new modular JSON structure.
*   **Resources:** Take the 7 resources currently defined in `shared/resources/resources.ts` and create 7 corresponding `.json` files in `definitions/resources/`.
*   **Prompts:** Take the 10 prompts currently defined in `shared/prompts/prompt-templates.ts` and create 10 corresponding `.json` files in `definitions/prompts/`.

#### **Action 3: Update Application to Use Generated Files**

*   **Task:** Ensure that the application correctly imports and uses the new, auto-generated TypeScript files. The import paths will not change, so this should work seamlessly after the build script runs.
*   **Validation:** After running the build script, run the application's test suite to confirm that all 22 tools, 7 resources, and 10 prompts are still correctly loaded and functional.

#### **Action 4: Final Cleanup**

*   **Task:** Once the new build process is working and all tests pass, the old, hardcoded content within `shared/resources/resources.ts` and `shared/prompts/prompt-templates.ts` can be completely removed. These files will now only contain the logic to export the data that is generated by the build script.

By completing these steps, you will have fully modernized the entire definition system, making it far more robust and easier to manage for the future.
