# Architectural Vision: The Road to a True Multi-Provider Platform

## The Goal: Ultimate Flexibility

The ultimate goal for **Jezweb MCP Core** is to be a single, powerful, and easy-to-maintain server that can connect to *any* AI or API provider we choose in the future.

We want to avoid building a separate server for every new AI we want to use. Instead, we are building one "smart hub" that knows how to talk to many different services (like OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, etc.).

This document outlines the strategy for the final architectural piece needed to achieve this vision: **Multi-Provider Routing**.

## Where We Are Today: A Powerful Engine

Right now, our server has a powerful and flexible "engine." We have successfully built a **provider-agnostic** system.

*   **Analogy:** Think of our server as a high-tech engine that is designed to run on different types of fuel (OpenAI's API, Google's API, etc.). We have built the engine in a generic way, so we *know* it's capable of using these different fuels.

This is a massive achievement and the most difficult part of the work is already done.

---

## The Missing Piece: A Fuel Selector

While our engine is capable of using different fuels, there is currently no "fuel selector switch." The server is hardwired to use only one provider at a time (currently OpenAI).

If we wanted to talk to Google Gemini, we would have to go into the server's code and manually switch the wiring. This is not flexible and doesn't allow us to use both OpenAI and Gemini at the same time from the same server.

---

## The Solution: One Server, Multiple Personalities

The solution is to give our single server multiple "personalities." From the outside, it will look like we are running different, specialized servers, but in reality, it's our one smart server handling all the requests.

We will achieve this using a simple and elegant approach: **URL-based routing**.

### How It Works (The User's Perspective)

From the perspective of a user with a client like Roo or Claude Desktop, the experience is simple and clear:

1.  **You will set up multiple "servers" in your client's configuration.** You are in complete control.

2.  Each configuration will point to our **single, live server**, but with a slightly different address. That small difference in the address acts as a "routing command."

    *   To talk to **OpenAI**, your client will connect to:
        `https://jezweb-mcp-core.pages.dev/mcp/openai/...`

    *   To talk to **Google Gemini**, your client will connect to:
        `https://jezweb-mcp-core.pages.dev/mcp/gemini/...`

    *   To talk to **Anthropic Claude**, your client will connect to:
        `https://jezweb-mcp-core.pages.dev/mcp/anthropic/...`

3.  When our server receives a request, it will simply look at the address. If it sees `/openai/`, it knows to use its internal OpenAI tools. If it sees `/gemini/`, it will use its internal Gemini tools.

## The Benefits of This Approach

This strategy is powerful because it's both simple and incredibly flexible.

*   **For the User:**
    *   **Complete Control:** You explicitly choose which AI provider to use by selecting the server in your client (e.g., `@jezweb-openai` vs `@jezweb-gemini`).
    *   **No Ambiguity:** There is no unpredictable "AI choosing an AI." The choice is always yours.
    *   **Simultaneous Access:** You can have conversations with different AI providers side-by-side, all powered by one server.

*   **For the Developer (Us):**
    *   **Extreme Simplicity:** We only have one codebase to maintain and deploy. A bug fix in the core logic instantly benefits all providers.
    *   **Easy to Add New Providers:** Adding a new AI in the future becomes a simple, repeatable process. We just create a new "provider plugin" internally and tell the server to listen for a new address (e.g., `/new-ai/`).

*   **For the Future:**
    *   **Infinitely Scalable:** This design can support dozens of different API providers without becoming complicated.
    *   **Flexible:** It allows us to create provider-specific tools. For example, some tools might only work for Gemini, and they will only be shown when you connect to the `/gemini/` address.

## What This Means for Adding Google Gemini

Once this routing architecture is in place, adding a completely new provider like Google Gemini becomes a straightforward "plugin" process:

1.  **Translate:** We'll write a new "Gemini Provider" file that translates our server's generic commands into the specific format the Google Gemini API understands.
2.  **Plug In:** We'll tell our server's main router to listen for the `/gemini/` address and to use the new Gemini Provider when it sees it.
3.  **Configure:** We'll add a `GEMINI_API_KEY` to our server's configuration.

That's it. The core logic of the server doesn't need to change at all.

## Conclusion

This multi-provider routing strategy is the final key to unlocking the full potential of the **Jezweb MCP Core** platform. It provides maximum flexibility for the future, complete control for the user, and elegant simplicity for development and maintenance. It is the right path forward to create a truly adaptable and powerful MCP server.
