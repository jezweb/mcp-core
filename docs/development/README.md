- **Current**: Fully data-driven system with JSON as single source of truth

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Process

### Data-Driven Development Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: The system is now fully data-driven. All tool, prompt, and resource definitions are stored in JSON files, not TypeScript files.

#### 1. JSON-First Development
- **Edit JSON Files**: All changes must be made to JSON files in `definitions/`
- **Never Edit Generated Files**: TypeScript files in `shared/` are auto-generated
- **Build System**: Use `npm run definitions:build` to generate TypeScript from JSON

#### 2. Definition Management
```bash
# Validate all definitions
npm run definitions:validate

# Build all definitions (generates TypeScript)
npm run definitions:build

# Watch for changes and auto-rebuild
npm run definitions:watch

# Build specific types
npm run definitions:tools
npm run definitions:prompts
npm run definitions:resources
```

#### 3. Adding New Definitions
1. **Create JSON File**: Add new `.json` file in appropriate `definitions/` subdirectory
2. **Follow Schema**: Ensure JSON follows the schema in `definitions/schemas/`
3. **Validate**: Run `npm run definitions:validate` to check schema compliance
4. **Build**: Run `npm run definitions:build` to generate TypeScript
5. **Test**: Run tests to ensure functionality works correctly

#### 4. Modifying Existing Definitions
1. **Edit JSON**: Modify the JSON file in `definitions/` (never the generated TypeScript)
2. **Validate**: Run validation to ensure schema compliance
3. **Rebuild**: Run build to regenerate TypeScript files
4. **Test**: Verify changes work as expected

### Version Management
1. **Semantic Versioning**: Following semver principles for version numbering
2. **Release Notes**: Detailed documentation of changes in each version
3. **Change Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of features, improvements, and fixes
4. **Milestone Planning**: Clear milestone definition and progress tracking

### Quality Assurance
1. **Schema Validation**: All JSON definitions must pass schema validation
2. **Code Review**: Systematic code review process for all changes
3. **Testing Requirements**: Comprehensive testing for all new features
4. **Documentation Standards**: Consistent documentation for all changes
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Performance impact assessment for changes

### Development Workflow
1. **JSON-First Planning**: Plan changes in terms of JSON definitions
2. **Schema Compliance**: Ensure all definitions follow established schemas
3. **Build Validation**: Verify build process generates correct TypeScript
4. **Review Process**: Multi-stage review including JSON and generated code validation
5. **Deployment Process**: Controlled deployment with validation
