## Architectural Modernization Plan

### 1. Unified Directory Structure

**Current Problematic Structure:**
```
❌ BEFORE (Duplicated)
├── shared/                    ← Master (advanced)
├── definitions/               ← Master (complete)
└── npm-package/
    ├── shared/               ← Duplicate (outdated)
    └── definitions/          ← Duplicate (identical)
```

**Target Unified Structure:**
```
✅ AFTER (Unified)
├── shared/                    ← SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
├── definitions/               ← SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
├── npm-package/
│   ├── src/                   ← NPM-specific source only
│   └── dist/                  ← Standardized build output
└── dist/                      ← Root build output
```

### 2. Critical Eliminations

#### 2.1 npm-package/shared/ Directory Removal
- **26 duplicate files** to be removed
- **Root shared/ directory** is more advanced and feature-complete
- **Critical behavioral differences** preserved in root version

#### 2.2 npm-package/definitions/ Directory Removal  
- **66 duplicate files** to be removed
- **100% identical currently** but creates maintenance burden
- **Root definitions/ directory** is authoritative source

#### 2.3 Build Artifacts Cleanup
- Remove `.js`/`.cjs` files from source control
- Standardize build output to `/dist` directories
- Update `.gitignore` to prevent future build artifact commits

#### 2.4 Obsolete Scripts Removal
- Remove `scripts/unification/` directory (4 files)
- Unification process is complete, scripts no longer needed

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Duplicate Removal ⚡
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Timeline:** Immediate  
**Actions:**
- Delete `npm-package/shared/` directory
- Delete `npm-package/definitions/` directory
- Verify tsconfig.json references (already correct)

### Phase 2: Build System Modernization 🔧
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Timeline:** Following Phase 1  
**Actions:**
- Remove build artifacts from source control
- Standardize `/dist` build outputs
- Update `.gitignore` patterns

### Phase 3: Cleanup and Validation ✅
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Timeline:** Final phase  
**Actions:**
- Remove obsolete `scripts/unification/` directory
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Documentation updates

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risk Analysis

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Import Path Failures** | Low | High | tsconfig.json already correctly configured |
| **Build Process Disruption** | Low | Medium | Verify build scripts reference root directories |
| **Behavioral Inconsistencies** | Medium | High | Use root directories as single source of truth |
| **Deployment Issues** | Low | High | Comprehensive cross-deployment testing |

### Rollback Strategy
```bash
# Emergency rollback plan
git checkout issue-3-cleanup-backup
git checkout -b issue-3-rollback
# Cherry-pick any necessary fixes
```
