   - **Issue:** Test looking for `universal-mcp-server.cjs` instead of `universal-mcp-server-old.cjs`
   - **Resolution:** Updated integration test to use correct filename
   - **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Outstanding Issues (Require Attention)

1. **NPM Package Integration Test Communication**
   - **Issue:** Integration tests cannot communicate with NPM package despite package working correctly
   - **Impact:** Medium (affects automated testing, not end-user functionality)
   - **Recommendation:** Investigate test harness stdio communication mechanism

2. **NPM Package Load Performance**
   - **Issue:** NPM package fails under concurrent load scenarios (10/10 failures)
   - **Impact:** Medium (affects high-load scenarios)
   - **Recommendation:** Investigate concurrent request handling in NPM package

3. **Configuration Validation Strictness**
   - **Issue:** Default configuration requires API key, making some tests complex
   - **Impact:** Low (affects test setup, not functionality)
   - **Recommendation:** Consider making API key optional in test/development modes

- **Simplified configuration system** works across all deployment types
- **Cloudflare Workers implementation** is production-ready with excellent performance
- **Backward compatibility** is maintained for existing users
- **TypeScript type safety** is preserved throughout the transformation
- **MCP protocol compliance** is maintained

### ⚠️ Areas Requiring Attention
- **NPM package load performance** needs optimization
