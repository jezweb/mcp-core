# Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation that has been archived as part of the documentation cleanup process. These files are historically valuable but no longer represent the current unified, provider-agnostic architecture.

## Archived Files

### PHASE-7-INTEGRATION-TESTING-VALIDATION-REPORT.md
- **Archived Date**: August 2, 2025
- **Reason**: This report documents integration testing from an earlier phase of development. While historically valuable, it does not reflect the current unified architecture.
- **Current Documentation**: See `UNIFIED-ARCHITECTURE-VALIDATION-REPORT.md` in the root directory for current validation information.

### DUPLICATION-AUDIT-REPORT.md
- **Archived Date**: August 2, 2025
- **Reason**: This audit report identified duplication issues that have since been resolved in the unified architecture. The findings are no longer relevant to the current codebase.
- **Current Documentation**: The unified architecture has eliminated the duplication issues identified in this report.
