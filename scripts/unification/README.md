# Unification Backup and Rollback Strategy

This directory contains comprehensive backup and rollback scripts for the codebase unification process. The strategy ensures that any unification step can be safely reversed if issues are detected.

## Backup Strategy

### 1. Pre-Unification Complete Backup
- **Full codebase snapshot** before any unification changes
- **Git repository state** including all branches and tags
- **Configuration files** and environment settings
- **Dependencies** and package lock files
- **Build artifacts** and generated files

### 2. Incremental Checkpoints
- **Phase-based checkpoints** at each major unification phase
- **File-level tracking** of all changes made
- **Dependency changes** and their impact
- **Test results** and validation status
- **Performance benchmarks** before and after changes

### 3. Metadata and Manifests
- **Change manifests** detailing what was modified
- **Dependency maps** showing interconnections
- **Rollback procedures** specific to each checkpoint
- **Validation checksums** for integrity verification
- **Timestamp tracking** for audit trails

## Rollback Strategy

### 1. Automated Rollback
- **One-command rollback** to any checkpoint
- **Dependency restoration** to previous states
- **Configuration rollback** including environment variables
- **Test validation** after rollback completion
- **Integrity verification** of restored state

### 2. Granular Rollback Options
- **Full rollback** to pre-unification state
- **Phase rollback** to specific unification phase
- **File-level rollback** for individual components
- **Dependency rollback** for specific packages
- **Configuration rollback** for settings only

### 3. Rollback Validation
- **Automated testing** after rollback
- **Dependency verification** and conflict detection
- **Performance validation** against baselines
- **Functionality testing** for critical paths
- **Deployment testing** for both targets

## Usage

### Creating Backups

```bash
# Create complete pre-unification backup
node scripts/unification/backup-manager.cjs --create-full-backup

# Create incremental checkpoint
node scripts/unification/checkpoint-manager.cjs --create-checkpoint "phase-3-1-complete"

# Create backup with custom metadata
node scripts/unification/backup-manager.cjs --create-backup --metadata "before-handler-consolidation"
```

### Managing Rollbacks

```bash
# List available rollback points
node scripts/unification/rollback-manager.cjs --list-checkpoints

# Rollback to specific checkpoint
node scripts/unification/rollback-manager.cjs --rollback-to "phase-3-1-complete"

# Rollback specific files only
node scripts/unification/rollback-manager.cjs --rollback-files "shared/core/handlers/*"

# Validate rollback integrity
node scripts/unification/rollback-manager.cjs --validate-rollback
```

### Checkpoint Management

```bash
# Create checkpoint with validation
node scripts/unification/checkpoint-manager.cjs --create --validate

# List all checkpoints
node scripts/unification/checkpoint-manager.cjs --list

# Verify checkpoint integrity
node scripts/unification/checkpoint-manager.cjs --verify "checkpoint-name"

# Clean old checkpoints
node scripts/unification/checkpoint-manager.cjs --cleanup --keep-last 5
```

## Safety Features

### 1. Integrity Verification
- **Checksum validation** for all backed up files
- **Dependency integrity** checking
- **Git repository validation** and consistency
- **Configuration validation** against schemas
- **Test suite validation** after restoration

### 2. Conflict Detection
- **File conflict detection** during rollback
- **Dependency conflict resolution** strategies
- **Configuration conflict** identification
- **Git merge conflict** prevention
- **Environment conflict** detection

### 3. Recovery Procedures
- **Partial rollback recovery** if rollback fails
- **Manual intervention points** for complex conflicts
- **Emergency recovery procedures** for critical failures
- **Data loss prevention** mechanisms
- **Audit trail preservation** throughout process

## Integration with CI/CD

### 1. Automated Backup Triggers
- **Pre-deployment backups** before any changes
- **Scheduled backups** during long-running processes
- **Event-driven backups** on critical milestones
- **Failure-triggered backups** when issues detected
- **Manual backup triggers** for ad-hoc needs

### 2. Rollback Integration
- **CI/CD rollback triggers** on test failures
- **Automated rollback** on deployment failures
- **Manual rollback approval** workflows
- **Rollback notification** systems
- **Post-rollback validation** pipelines

## Best Practices

### 1. Backup Management
- **Regular backup validation** to ensure integrity
- **Storage space monitoring** and cleanup
- **Backup retention policies** based on importance
- **Offsite backup storage** for critical checkpoints
- **Access control** and security measures

### 2. Rollback Procedures
- **Test rollback procedures** in safe environments
- **Document rollback decisions** and reasoning
- **Validate system state** after every rollback
- **Communicate rollback status** to stakeholders
- **Learn from rollback events** for improvement

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Backup success/failure monitoring**
- **Rollback event tracking** and analysis
- **Storage usage alerts** and management
- **Integrity check failures** immediate notification
- **Performance impact monitoring** during operations

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Critical Failure Recovery
- **Emergency rollback procedures** for system failures
- **Data recovery strategies** for corruption scenarios
- **Service restoration priorities** and procedures
- **Stakeholder communication** during emergencies
- **Post-incident analysis** and improvement

### 2. Disaster Recovery
- **Complete system restoration** from backups
- **Alternative deployment strategies** if needed
- **Data integrity verification** after restoration
- **Service validation** and testing procedures
- **Business continuity** maintenance during recovery

This backup and rollback strategy provides comprehensive protection during the unification process, ensuring that any issues can be quickly and safely resolved while maintaining system integrity and availability.
