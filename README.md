  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'

# Create an assistant
curl -X POST "https://openai-assistants-mcp.jezweb.ai/mcp/YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "assistant-create",
      "arguments": {
        "name": "Test Assistant",
        "instructions": "You are a helpful assistant."
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Test the NPM Package directly:

```bash
# Test stdio transport
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | npx openai-assistants-mcp@latest
